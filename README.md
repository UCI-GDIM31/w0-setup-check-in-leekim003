# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

I am Kimmy Lee who is a sophomore. My current major is art but if I take this class, I would be able to change my major into Game Design and Interactive Media. I like to play League of Legends which I played for 6 years. I have made flappy bird before wiith unity but I would like to improve and learn more about programming. 


2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I would like to learn more about game programming language and apply on unity. 

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
Since I do not have a lot of experience with coding, I am afraid that I would not be able to catch up with class. 

## Prior Experience

This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers.
